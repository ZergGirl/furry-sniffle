First repository while learning Github.
My name is Kathy and I work in sales. I stream video games online. I get visitors from all over the world! I have a loving boyfriend and had two-well now one cat. I enjoy technology and reading, my favorite genres being science-fiction and fantasy. Sometimes, I paint and draw. I enjoy collecting hand-made keycaps to put on my keyboard! Thanks for stopping by.
